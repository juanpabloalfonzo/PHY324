    "Python is a popular and versatile programming language used for a wide variety of tasks, ranging from software development to data science and machine learning to web development to scientific programming like physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other languages it has a simple syntax similar to English, making it quite simple to learn. Furthermore, it is an interpreted language, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can be written in any text editor like as Notepad or vim. Your file can then be run in a Python console. Alternatively, you can write Python in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which improves the ease with which you can write/ run code, has a bunch of debugging features, manage large collections of Python files, and so on. These include Spyder, Pycharm, Atom, and so on. In the physics community Spyder is quite popular and used in PHY224, so I'd recommend using that.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will go over the basic functionality of Python, including basic syntax, datatypes, functions, loops and conditionals, working with directories, and reading/ writing data. Basic features of the numpy and matplotlib libraries will also be introduced, most notably the numpy array datatype and basic plotting functions. No previous programming experience is needed!"
